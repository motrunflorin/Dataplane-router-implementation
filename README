Functions:

trie.c : insert() :

    - inserts a routing table entry into the trie
    - according to the bits in the prefix

get_best_route() (Longest Prefix Match) :

    - search in trie
    - find the best matching routing entry from a routing table

get_mac_entry() :

    - search for an entry that matches IP destination 

icmp() :

    - generate ICMP packets with s specific type
    - construct IP header and Ethernet header
    - send ICMP packet to specified interface

main(): 
    
    - allocate memory for arp_table and rtable
    - read arp_table and rtable
    - create  trie and populate with rtable

    - verify checksum of IP header
    if old and new checksum not matching
        - the packet is invalid and is discarded
        - buf zeroed and continue

    if destination IP address == IP address of the interface
        - generate and send Echo Reply messaje; tpye 0
    
    if nexthop router not found or no rute available tot the destination network
        - generate and send Destination Unreachable messaje; type 3
     
    
    if ttl of the received IP packet expires
        - generate and send Time Exceded messaje; type 11

    - update ttl and checksum
    - find destination MAC address
    - find nexthop
    - send packet
